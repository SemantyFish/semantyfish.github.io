								<p>The project implementation is organized into four distinct work packages; 
									<b>WP1</b> will carry out the FishBase resources analysis, as well as the design and implementation of the semantic knowledge base (KB) 
									of FishBase. <b>WP2</b> elaborates on the development of the FishBase KB API that will expose the contents of the KB. 
									<b>WP3</b> summarizes the exploitation and dissemination activities ensuring that the results of the projects are well 
									communicated and disseminated. <b>WP4</b> will carry out the activities related to the contribution of the project in related Research 
									Infrastructures and EOSC.

											<li><strong>T1.1 Definition of Ontology [M1-M2]</strong></li>
											This task will implement the conceptual model that will be used as the schema of the FishBase Knowledge Base (KB). 
											Instead of designing and creating an ontology from scratch, this task will reuse related ontologies 
											(i.e. MarineTLO, Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Ontology) and extend them accordingly. 
											FishBase data encoders will facilitate in properly identifying difficult definitions, and for possible important corrections of 
											the database if needed. <br>
											<li><strong>T1.2 Definition of Schema Mappings [M3-M6]</strong></li>
											The schema mapping resources that are needed for transforming data described with respect to the original relational schema of 
											FishBase to ontological instances using the adopted ontology will be defined. The schema mappings will be defined using 
											state-of-the-art technologies, they will be described in a technology-neutral manner and will be used for the periodic 
											reconstruction of FishBase knowledge base. <br>
											<li><strong>T1.3 Construction of FishBase Knowledge Base [M3-M9]</strong></li>
											An automatic workflow resulting in the construction of the knowledge base will be implemented. The workflow will use as input a 
											complete dump of the relational database of FishBase, and the schema mappings defined above, it will construct the ontological
											instances and add them into an appropriate RDF database (e.g. an RDF triplestore).

											<li><strong>T2.1 API Design and Specification [M5-M9]</strong></li>
											The API should provide access to all the resources of FishBase KB.
											This phase includes the definition of the primary endpoints and methods that the API will encompass. 
											They will serve as the backbone of the API, facilitating seamless interaction with the vast array of data and information in the KB.
											Additionally, a detailed specification will be drafted using OpenAPI specification.<br>
											<li><strong>T2.2 Implementation of the API [M10-M18]</strong></li>
											The API will be implemented using GraphQL providing developers great flexibility and control over data fetching and manipulation. 
											By adopting GraphQL, developers will enjoy a sophisticated framework that allows for precise specification of data requirements, 
											enabling them to request only the specific data elements needed for their applications. This approach contrasts with traditional 
											REST APIs, providing a more efficient and tailored data retrieval process. Activities will begin with the design and creation of a 
											GraphQL schema defining the types of data available and the relationships between them. 
											Then the API will be equipped with appropriate resolvers, acting as the middleware responsible for fetching the requested data. 
											Finally, a set of queries will be implemented to enable developers to interact seamlessly with the API. <br>

											participating in related workshops and conferences in the domain, as well as organizing a hackathon prompting
											developers to use FishBase API, targeting first heavy users known to be interested in such API.

											<li><strong>T3.2 Exploitation and Sustainability [M13-M24]</strong></li>
											This task will set the seal on project outcomes, making sure they are effectively utilized and sustained also beyond the project duration. 
											In parallel with the activities of task T3.1, this task will identify the potential stakeholders and end-users and will seek to 
											establish partnerships to support the adoption of project outcomes. <br>

											strengthen the collaboration with them, promote the usability of FishBase KB and API,

											<li><strong>T4.2 EOSC and Sustainability [M19-M24]</strong></li>
											This task aims to promote the project results and strengthen its exploitability by registering them to the EOSC portal.

											potential linking with compatible resources from the EOSC portal. <br>
