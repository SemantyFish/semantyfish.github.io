							<p>
								<a href="https://www.fishbase.org/" target="_blank">FishBase</a>
								is the globally most accessed specialized database about marine and freshwater fishes providing information about life cycle and history, 
								population dynamics, ecology, distribution, taxonomy, human uses and several other aspects of fish biology. 
								It was established to to serve researchers, policymakers, educators, and enthusiasts, FishBase offers comprehensive, 
								peer-reviewed information on over 35,700 species of fish, 330,100 common names and 62,000 references to the scientific literature 
								(according to FishBase website,version 2024/06). It is currently accessed 23,000 times daily to 
								consult and/or download marine animals information as well as for species identification and references. 
								FishBase is continuously updated with new information contributed by experts in the field, 
								making it an invaluable resource for the fisheries domain. FishBase resources are accessible through replicating websites 
								allowing users to search and find the desired resources, using various search forms.
							</p>

							<p>FishBase was initially developed as a tool to assist fisheries scientists in managing fish stocks, 
								its development was spearheaded by Dr. Daniel Pauly and Dr. Rainer Froese. 
								The initial goal was to include information about 200 major species, with utlimate goal of 2,500 species. 
								The first version was released in 1990 as a stand-alone database, but with the rise of the internet, 
								FishBase was transitioned into an online platform. This move significantly broadened its accessibility and user base. 
								Over the years, the database has continued to grow and is regularly updated by a global network of researchers and contributors.
							</p>

							<p>
								FishBase provides an extensive repository of data on fish species, 
								ranging from basic taxonomy and classification to detailed biological and ecological information. 
								Its database includes data on speciesâ€™ distribution, habitats, feeding behavior, population dynamics, 
								and life-history traits. Additionally, it features tools for ecological modeling, 
								such as length-weight relationships and trophic level calculations. FishBase also incorporates multimedia elements, 
								such as photos and illustrations of fish species, making it visually informative. It serves as a vital resource for 
								identifying species, assessing their conservation status, and studying their roles in ecosystems.
